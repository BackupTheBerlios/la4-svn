TODO
----

General:
- Logging "framework"
  * Improve support (enable/disable level or category)
  * Log in stdout or stderr depending on level
  * Use it in all classes

LoadFilePlugin:
- Basic loading of document
- Add a XmlSerialiser class to load document from XML format
  * Implement different methods according to format

LACATRE_Doc:
- The document platform should not be changed when already set

LAObjectFactory/LAMetaObject:
- Improve loading support

PlatformManager:
- Implement object creation mechanism from platform (ref to Document must be provided)
- Reload of platform manager (issue warning if factories have doc associated to them)
- getAlgoPlatform for platform manager
- getPlatformByName for platform manager

Next step:
- Basic loading of a document (name or something like that in the menu bar)
- Configuration change of the xml definitions path correctly handled
- Basic loading correctly handled (windows and buttons behave correcty)

LA4 Project

Last update: 04/23/2005 (jl314)

------------------
LA4 User Interface
------------------

Always
------
	- Clean up:
	  * Find/correct memory leaks
  	* Find/correct all segfaults introduced by correction of memory
    	leaks  ;+)
		* Remove all error message (use qDebug() and #undef DEBUG)

	- UI
		* i18n

0.9.3
-----
	- Reengineering of the LAkernel
		* Implement a real Model/View pattern
			+ LAkernel
			+ ViewPlugin

	Status
	------
		Work in progress: This step is difficult because the program loses
		features and you readd them one by one. The CVS will be marked
		0.9.3 and the first redesign will be commited. A warning should be
		put in the website.

0.9.3.1
-------
	- Change file format
		* Stencil descriptions: Add
			+ Line width
			+ Respect ratio for certain parts of the drawing
			+ Conditional decos/texts according to parameter values
		* SaveFile
			+ Separate view from model (each plugin stores its usefull
				information)
				For example: View stores active/inactive/visible/invisible layers
			+ Layer handling: add a layer section

	- Update platforms according to it

0.9.3.2
-------
	- Implement features induces by the file change in 0.9.3.1

	- Correct layer handling
		* Add/Remove from layer

0.9.3.3
-------
	- Print plugin refactoring and polishing
		* Add connectors
		* Add document information (no config at all, just add them)

0.9.3.4
-------
	- Various features/UI design
		* Add menu items for zoom
		* Icons for algo and added objects
		* Documentation plugin (if possible)
		* Document information modify dialog
		* Zoom positionning
		* Code generation review
			+ Support for one global file vs. one file per object
			+ Support for code generator selection or parametrisation

Next milestone: 0.9.4
---------------------

	- 0.9.3.4 done and no message output.

Should be done next or meanwhile:
---------------------------------
	- Clean up all code (comment it (doxygen.error = 0), reorder methods alphabetically, ...)
			This is not mandatory, but could be cool in fact (jl314)
	- Color configuration
	- Font support
	- LASettings (find a solution for it)
	- Write a documentation of the program and of LACATRE
	- Remove all known bugs
	- Make a binary release for Linux and Windows/Cygwin (waiting for Qt 4...)
	- Review makefile and configure: use qmake, add lrelease target when
	building the application.

Future features:
----------------
	- Diagram verification and TODO list (e.g. "Semaphore mySem is not created")
	- Miniview
	- Antialias on view (Waiting for Qt 4)

Various bugs/features from the previous TODO:
---------------------------------------------

 - clean this list according to CVS ;-)

 - remove the active factory and return to "select" mode when loading a file

 - a stupid bug caused me to segfault when adding a stencil. (note:
ulimit -c 65000 to generate core files) I solved the problem by
commenting out the faulty line in LADocument.h (search for TODO), but
then the objects would not resize anymore. Un uncommented it later,
and it works again. Maybe there's a problem there.

 - A "modified since last save" tag, was added, but it is never
updated whe the document is modified. Do that.

 - Added document title, authors, comments, date to the LADocument.
Now, display that information on the document itself (useful when
printing). Make a dialog box to ask for such informations.

 - Bug: According to the specs, a target which does not have the
appropriate, conform stencils should not be offered to the user. Now,
a target with no stencils whatsoever is being offered. This was the
case with the "CVS" target. I added a dirty hack in the dialog window
to solve that, but its still not satisfactory. Does a plain invalid
target get loaded? A target w/ no definitions shouldn't either.

 - Add support for paper size?

 - Memory leaks!!! I bet we're almost drowned under memory leaks, if
only the ones I added myself.

 - Validate the savefile before loading it.

LA4 Platforms
-------------

mCOS-II
-------
	- Add microCOS-II platform
	 * Review all xml files and reorganise them
	 * Code generation has to be reviewed

vxWorks
-------
	- Add objects
		* Resource
		* Interrupt
		* Semaphore (binary, mutex, count)

	- Document all

	- Add description file of the code generator

	- Add parameters for
		* One global file/one file per task/alaram/interrupt

iRMX
----
	- Not maintained at all. If someone is interested in it and has some
	ideas to submit, send a mail to <la4-dev@lists.berlios.de>

examples/Sample real-time system
--------------------------------
	- Think about it and make it a real sample platform

-------
Website
-------

	- Update roadmap
	- Add a real real-time example instead of the dummy one
	- When the docbook manual will be added to CVS, add the
	html to the website
